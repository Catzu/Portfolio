        <p class="onderdeelText">This is my welcome back website after the summer break. <br> 
          We as students were tasked with filling in a list with what we have done, what we were doing and what we still needed to do to graduate. <br>
          The next step was to make a timeline of all these things and giving everything a time of what will be done. <br>
          Afterwards we had to write self-reflections of our second year as Cohort 9 and we were to tell what went good and what went wrong for us that year <br>
          Then our last step was finalizing it in code and putting in our website <br>

        <p class="onderdeelText">
            The second year of Cohort 9 was pretty rough. This was the first time we would stay home and study full time from home. Personally I had trouble adapting to studying at home and failed to seek help early on in that year, but best thing that had overcome me was the bit academy internship. It was refreshing to have someone from bit academy to come and have us work in scrum teams. It was really a good experience to have because I would dare to say I had no teamwork experience before that. With their guidance we were able to make a kind of playable game. Of course the days where I was the most productive would’ve been the days I was working at school on the project and the last few days till the deadline. <br><br>
            Working home is a tough one for me but I’m starting to get used to working from home. Not only am I starting to think of home as a comfortable place only but I‘m also thinking of home as a work place where I can study etc. <br><br>
            The hardest obstacle of the second year would be me not finding motivation, being lazy and procrastinating things/work while being home. But those are all points where I can work on and better myself in.
