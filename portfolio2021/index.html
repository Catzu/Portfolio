                <h3 class="subtext">This project was created while working in a project week on school. The requirements were finishing the project in the week time we were given. It had to be coded in a program called Greenfoot and published to the GreenFoot website. <br><br>GreenFoot is an integrated development environment using Java. In this week I learned to work better with Java to make an interactive game. <br><br>This game uses the w,a,s,d keys to walk into directions and I coded it in a way that when you press a movement key such as D the sprite would walk right. In this game I worked on the movements, movement animations, shooting, shooting animations, HP bar, score counter, heart tracking and music integration.</h3>

                <h3 class="subtext">In this project we were tasked to make an website, sounds rather easy right? Well it was our first experience working in a group of 4 people.<br><br>We had 5 pages, header and footer. So we divided the workload by giving everyone alteast 1 page to complete so they could do whatever they wished to do with that page. We gave the homepage, header, footer to the 3 people who finished early and the last person had to link all the pages together. <br><br> I personally contributed to linken pages with each other, Recepten page, Sport page, Home page, Header and footer.</h3>

                <h3 class="subtext">In this project we were orignally in a group of 4 but expanded to 5 due an student entering late. We had multiple project topics to choose from and personally I wouldn't have chosen for this one due the heavy game programming it required but I had gotten out voted. My reasoning for this was that I personally knew I would get a hard task(I was right)<br><br>I was tasked with the game logic for the type-racer. I personally didn't know much about php at the time so making this was quite daunting at the time. As we got closer to the deadline I began to notice I started to fall behind and requested help from my fellow groupmates. Together we had finished the project in the nick of time. <br><br> due our incompetence to communicate I learned how important it was to communicate with each other.</h3>

                <h3 class="subtext">During my internship at Raion Design I had learned a lot of webdesigning and wordpress. Things that I was looking to learn so I would go outside my comfort zone. I produced and created a lot of websites throughout my internship, but I'm most happy of this one since I was so passionate about it and their noble cause! <br><br>In this project I was orignally assigned to make the homepage but in the end I was able to try and do everything with the guidance and help of my superviser.<br><br>I'm proud to say that ive spend my time well and that this internship was worth the 5 months. I learned communicating with my collegues, wring notes, I got more active in speaking about problems and I got proficient in working with wordpress</h3>

It really was tough and challeging but also really fun to do.</h3>
